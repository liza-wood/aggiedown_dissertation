The challenges facing agricultural systems -- biodiversity loss, climate
change, and corporate consolidation of food production, to name a few --
demand transitions to more environmentally and socially sustainable
agricultural systems
[Hebinck_Klerkx_Elzen_Kok_König_Schiller_Tschersich_van Mierlo_von
Wirth_2021](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rSRxF3). Supporting
sustainability transitions, however, is no easy task. While the decision
to adopt a new technology or change behavior is made at the individual
level
[Buttel_Jr_Larson_1990_Rogers_2003](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Y0Mte3),
individuals are shaped by the broader innovation system in which they
are nested [Klerkx_van
Mierlo_Leeuwis_2012](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?DvQAj1). An
innovation system is the complex of interactions between actors and
institutions that nurture and diffuse new technologies or practices
based on several interdependent processes, such as policymaking,
knowledge creation, and market formation
[Bergek_Jacobsson_Carlsson_Lindmark_Rickne_2008](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?sr9u3m).
The interplay between individual behaviors and system level processes is
at the core of successful innovation and transitions. Which processes to
foster for successful transitions, at what scale, and by whom are core
questions in the niche management and innovation system literature
[Binz_Truffer_2017_Musiolik_Markard_Hekkert_Furrer_2020_Smith_Raven_2012_Suurs_2009](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Y02tfR).

Across three chapters, this dissertation addresses questions about
sustainability transitions at both the individual and system levels
using the case of organic seed. Among the inputs necessary for
supporting a sustainable agricultural system, seeds are one of the most
foundational. While the dominant seed breeding approach in countries
like the United States is based on high-input, low-diversity and highly
centralized conventional agricultural practices [Lammerts van
Bueren_Struik_van
Eekeren_Nuijten_2018](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?QxCtrS),
several alternatives (so-called \"niches\") have developed to support a
more sustainable system. This work focuses on the organic agriculture
niche, in which seed production systems are typically low-input and high
diversity with polycentric management
[Colley_2022_Rohe_Oltmer_Wolter_Gmeiner_Tschersich_2022_Shelton_Tracy_2015](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ZMVKpi).
The focus on organic seeds was inspired by the Organic Seed Alliance\'s
(OSA) *State of Organic Seed Reports*
[Dillon_Hubbard_2011_Hubbard_Zystro_2016](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?T9FO7R).
OSA\'s research conceives of organic seed as part of a broader system --
not just breeding and agronomy, but also policy support, funding
mobilization, community building, and small business development. This
framing mirrors the innovation systems approach, where environmental
challenges require system-level assessments that connect and transcend
disciplines.

The focus of Chapter 1 is on the organic standards in the United States,
specifically, the so-called \"seed loophole\" whereby growers can use
conventional seed if organic seed is not commercially available and
still retain their organic status. We investigate whether this loophole
helps reduce organic growers\' seed sourcing burden, as the policy
intends, or enables them to free-ride by using conventional seed despite
commercial availability. Drawing on organic grower survey data from
three cross-sections over the last 15 years, we use beta regression to
model individual growers\' seed sourcing behavior. The results of the
regression suggest that the loophole is a double-edged sword in that it
both helps growers facing seed sourcing barriers, and allows some
growers to take advantage of the flexibility by reducing their efforts
in sourcing organic seed. The chapter concludes with several policy
recommendations, which align with the 2022 *State of Organic Seed
Report*
[Hubbard_Zystro_Wood_2022](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?XzyfRv).
Beyond, it opens up a wider discussion about competing motivations and
identities in sustainability transitions to be considered in future
research.

Chapters 2 and 3 broaden the scope of study from the individual-level to
the system-level. Both of these chapters draw on innovation system
theory, combined with policy network and social network literature, to
quantify and explain the relationships within the organic seed
innovation system as a network. We use survey data of over 200 organic
seed stakeholders within and outside the United States, collected
between 2020-2022, to create a multi-functional innovation system
network comprising 645 actors and 1206 connections between them. These
connections operationalize knowledge and market-based relationships
between organic seed producers, researchers, companies, and non-profit
organizations.

In detail, Chapter 2 focuses on explaining the spatial structure of the
US organic seed network, testing the propositions defined by the Global
Innovation Systems framework
[Binz_Truffer_2017](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Gd8gyP). Using
n-clan compositional analysis and Exponential Random Graph Modeling, we
find support for the framework\'s proposition that types of innovation
and production valuation are two key conditions predicting the
innovation network\'s spatial structure. In line with these conditions,
we find that the organic seed system has a \"spatially sticky\" network
structure, in that both knowledge creation and product valuation are
territorially embedded in different regions of the country. But even in
a regionally sticky innovation system, we find that national-scale
actors (e.g. the US national germplasm repository) serve a prominent
role in connecting regional networks. These results highlight both the
importance of tailoring policies to the place-specific needs of regional
organic seed systems, and the importance of coordination from
higher-scale actors.

Chapter 3 investigates the processes and actor composition of the
organic seed innovation system. Again using Exponential Random Graph
Modeling on the organic seed networks, we test two theories in parallel:
resource-based theory of system building
[Musiolik_Markard_Hekkert_Furrer_2020](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?H6obWt)
and the institutional logics of the multi-actor perspective
[Avelino_Wittmayer_2016](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?pNAlBv). In
line with the expectations from the resource-based theory, we find that
the organic seed network is shaped primarily by \"partner mode\"
structures, suggesting that cooperative and complementary
resource-sharing relationships drive system formation. Second, our
results align with the proposition that actors\' \"institutional
logics\" affect their activity in certain network functions. For
example, non-profit actors are generally more active in pre-competitive
activities like knowledge creation, while for-profit actors are more
active in market-based functions like value chain creation. The one
exception is governmental actors, who are more active in market-based
functions, pointing to their innovation-nurturing role when niches are
not yet competitive.

Together, the chapters in this dissertation make the following
contributions. Chapter 1 analyzes the effects of the \"seed loophole\"
in the United States organic standard, and makes several policy
recommendations for achieving the intended effects of the policy while
curbing free-riding behavior on the part of organic growers. Chapters 2
and 3 contribute to the field of sustainability transitions by
empirically testing and extending innovation system theory using
inferential network analysis. By employing Exponential Random Graph
Models, these chapters not only describe the organic seed network, but
also investigate its structural determinants to help build a more
generalizable understanding of innovation system formation. This work
combines theory and methods from the two otherwise disparate bodies of
knowledge on innovation systems and policy networks, to help deepen our
understanding of managing and supporting sustainability transitions.

abstractNote={This paper contributes to understanding transition
politics by conceptualizing (shifting) power relations between actors in
sustainability transitions. The authors introduce a Multi-actor
Perspective as a heuristic framework for specifying (shifting) power
relations between different categories of actors at different levels of
aggregation. First, an overview is provided of how power and empowerment
have been treated in transition research, and remaining questions are
identified on who exercises power and who is empowered by and with whom.
It is argued that theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses in
transition studies lack precision when it comes to distinguishing
between different types and levels of actors. In response, a Multi-actor
Perspective (MaP) is developed, which distinguishes among four sectors
(state, market, community, third sector), and between actors at
different levels of aggregation: (1) sectors, (2) organizational actors,
and (3) individual actors. The paper moves on to specify how the MaP
contributes to understanding transition politics specifically in
conceptualizing shifting power relations. Throughout the paper,
empirical illustrations are used regarding public debates on welfare
state reform, civil society and 'Big Society', as well as more specific
empirical examples of community energy initiatives.}, number={5},

valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework
is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries.

ISBN={978-0-313-26444-3}, abstractNote={Published to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the Rural Sociological Society, this monograph
analyzes the nearly 90 years of rural sociological research on
agriculture and provides a comprehensive overview of changing research
focuses and theoretical approaches. As the authors note at the outset,
there are a good number of continuities between early-20th-century rural
sociology and what is now called the sociology of agriculture. There are
also, they note, very substantial differences between contemporary
sociology of agriculture scholarship and that which preceded it. Their
aim throughout is to convey both continuities and discontinuities in
theory, method, and approach. Intended primarily as a straightforward
exposition of major scholarly themes, the volume is designed to be
useful to readers from a variety of theoretical persuasions. The authors
do, however, point to areas of weakness in theoretical or methodological
approach that should be addressed in future research.The volume is
organized around the three major eras of rural sociological
conceptualizations of agriculture. The authors begin by examining the
founding of U.S. rural sociology shortly after the turn of the century
until the early 1950s, demonstrating that during this initial era the
study of agriculture was largely construed as one of the many elements
necessary for understanding the social fabric of rural community life.
In the next section, they explore the social psychological/behaviorist
tradition, which held sway from the early 1950s through the early 1970s
and which conceptualized farmers as actors responding to stimuli such as
new technologies and educational opportunities. The three chapters
devoted to recent research in the emerging tradition of the new rural
sociology address such topics as the political economy of agriculture,
the environment of agriculture, and major theoretical trends in the
sociology of agriculture. In their concluding chapter, the authors look
toward the future of the sociology of agriculture and identify some
potential problems as we move into the 1990s.}, publisher={Praeger},

abstractNote={How the growing world population can feed itself is a
crucial, multi-dimensional problem that goes beyond sustainable
development. Crop production will be affected by many changes in its
climatic, agronomic, economic, and societal contexts. Therefore,
breeders are challenged to produce cultivars that strengthen both
ecological and societal resilience by striving for six international
sustainability targets: food security, safety and quality; food and seed
sovereignty; social justice; agrobiodiversity; ecosystem services; and
climate robustness. Against this background, we review the state of the
art in plant breeding by distinguishing four paradigmatic orientations
that currently co-exist: community-based breeding, ecosystem-based
breeding, trait-based breeding, and corporate-based breeding, analyzing
differences among these orientations. Our main findings are: (1) all
four orientations have significant value but none alone will achieve all
six sustainability targets; (2) therefore, an overarching approach is
needed: "systems-based breeding," an orientation with the potential to
synergize the strengths of the ways of thinking in the current
paradigmatic orientations; (3) achieving that requires specific
knowledge development and integration, a multitude of suitable breeding
strategies and tools, and entrepreneurship, but also a change in
attitude based on corporate responsibility, circular economy and
true-cost accounting, and fair and green policies. We conclude that
systems-based breeding can create strong interactions between all system
components. While seeds are part of the common good and the basis of
agrobiodiversity, a diversity in breeding approaches, based on different
entrepreneurial approaches, can also be considered part of the required
agrobiodiversity. To enable systems-based breeding to play a major role
in creating sustainable agriculture, a shared sense of urgency is needed
to realize the required changes in breeding approaches, institutions,
regulations and protocols. Based on this concept of systems-based
breeding, there are opportunities for breeders to play an active role in
the development of an ecologically and societally resilient, sustainable
agriculture.}, number={5}, journal={Agronomy for Sustainable

depends on resource constellations at a certain point in time. Drawing
from research in the field of stationary fuel cells in Germany, we
identify three generic modes, of system building: a) the "single mode",
in which a system builder uses its own organizational resources to
create a system resource, b) the "partner mode", in which a system
builder joins forces with partners in order to co-create system
resources, and c) the "intermediary mode", in which a system builder
collaborates with other actors to set up an intermediary organization,
which then works towards the creation of system resources. We show that
the modes were chosen depending on i) what resources were initially
available and ii) how they were distributed in the innovation system.

few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word

months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the
1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other
innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is
changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of

Reconsidering niches in transitions to sustainability}, volume={41},
ISSN={00487333}, DOI={10.1016/J.RESPOL.2011.12.012}, abstractNote={The
transitions literature emphasises the role of niches, defined as a
protective space for path-breaking innovations. Surprisingly, the
concept of protection has not been systematically interrogated. Our
analysis identifies effective protection as having three properties in
wider transition processes: shielding, nurturing and empowerment.
Empowerment is considered the least developed in current niche
literature. It can be understood as either processes that make niche
innovations competitive within unchanged selection environments
(fit-and-conform) or as processes that contribute to changes in
mainstream selection environments in ways favourable to a path-breaking
niche innovation (stretch-and-transform). Adopting a more constructivist
perspective, we subsequently argue that analysis of these properties
needs to be complemented with particular attention for the politics
involved in their construction. Attention to empowerment confirms the
view that niche actors need to link to wider processes of social change,
and suggests how this arises. The paper ends with an outlook upon two
promising research avenues: (1) the reconstruction of niche development
in light of the present framework; (2) analyses of the diverse
(political) narratives seeking to empower niches across time and space.
