The challenges facing agricultural systems -- biodiversity loss, climate
change, corporate consolidation, and loss of food sovereignty, to name a
few -- demand transitions to more environmentally and socially
sustainable agricultural systems [(Hebinck et al.
2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rSRxF3). Supporting
sustainability transitions, however, is no easy task. The decision to
adopt a new technology or change behavior is made at the individual
level, which is influenced by factors like attitudes and available
resources [(Buttel, Jr, and Larson 1990; Rogers
2003)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Y0Mte3). These individual
factors, however, are shaped by the broader innovation system in which
an individual is nested [(Klerkx, van Mierlo, and Leeuwis
2012)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?DvQAj1). Innovation systems
(IS) are the interactions between actors and institutions that nurture
and diffuse new technologies or practices based on several
interdependent processes, such as knowledge creation and policy guidance
[(Bergek et al. 2008)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?sr9u3m).
Which processes to foster, at what scale, and to what end, are core
questions in the niche management and innovation system literature
[(Binz and Truffer 2017; Musiolik et al. 2020; Smith and Raven 2012;
Suurs 2009)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Y02tfR); the answers
help support the governance of successful transitions towards more
sustainable forms of management [(Jacobsson and Bergek
2011)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?pDfkR9).

This dissertation addresses questions about sustainability transitions
at both the individual and system level using the case of the organic
seed system. Among the inputs necessary for supporting a sustainable
agricultural system, seeds are one of the most foundational. While the
dominant seed breeding approach in countries like the United States is
based on high-input, low-diversity and highly centralized conventional
agricultural practices [(Lammerts van Bueren et al.
2018)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?QxCtrS), several niche
alternatives have developed to support a more sustainable system. This
work focuses on organic agriculture, in which seed production systems
are typically low-input and high diversity with polycentric modes of
management [(Colley 2022; Rohe et al. 2022; Shelton and Tracy
2015)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ZMVKpi).

The organic seed research community has inspired the work of this
dissertation, particularly Organic Seed Alliance\'s *State of Organic
Seed Reports* [(Dillon and Hubbard 2011; Hubbard and Zystro 2016;
Hubbard, Zystro, and Wood
2022)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?T9FO7R). Their research
positions organic seed as part of a broader system; seed is about
breeding and agronomy, of course, but also policy, funding, community
building, and small business development. These reports mirror the
innovation systems approach, where environmental challenges require
systems-level assessments that connect and transcend disciplines.

Using the case of organic seed, this dissertation includes three
chapters. The focus of Chapter 1 is on the flexible policy setting in
which organic growers are situated -- namely the organic seed loophole
which allows organic growers to use conventional seed based on
commercial availability. We ask whether the loophole helps reduce
growers\' undue seed sourcing burden or enables them to free-ride. The
results suggest that growers use the loophole differently depending on
their motivations and operational profiles. These findings guide us in
making several policy recommendations, and help open up a wider
conversation about niche identity in sustainability transitions.

Chapters 2 and 3 broaden the scope of study to take a systems-level
focus on organic seed. Both of these papers draw on theories of
innovation systems, combined with the policy network and social network
literature, to quantify the organic seed innovation system as a network.
Chapter 2 focuses on the spatial boundaries of the organic seed system,
testing the conditions defined by the Global Innovation Systems
framework for predicting spatial innovation system structure. We find...
support for the framework, which proposes that innovation mode and
production valuation are two key conditions predicting a network\'s
spatial structure. The organic seed system is a \'spatially sticky\'
innovation system, in that both the knowledge and market subsystems of
the IS are regionally embedded. These results highlight the importance
of... regional or state level policies to tailor to the needs of the
seed system, while still relying on

Chapter 3 looks at the social structures occurring in the organic seed
network, and draws on resource-based theory to test the relationship
between existing system resources and paired, cooperative efforts. We
find...

Both Chapters 2 and 3 make theoretical and methodological contributions
to the field of sustainability transitions. I engage with IS and
sustainability transitions theories that seek to do more than describe
the system, but rather, understand the conditions that shape it. By
using inferential network analyses, exponential random graph models, we
broaden the toolkit for testing IS theories that are developing around
network formation. These methods help directly test and validate two
theories in the field, Global innovation Systems framework and the
resource-based theory of strategic system building
