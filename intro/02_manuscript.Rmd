The challenges facing agricultural systems -- biodiversity loss, climate
change, and corporate consolidation of food production, to name a few --
demand transitions to more environmentally and socially sustainable
agricultural systems
[@Hebinck_Klerkx_Elzen_Kok_KÃ¶nig_Schiller_Tschersich_van_Mierlo_von_Wirth_2021]. Supporting
sustainability transitions, however, is no easy task. While the decision
to adopt a new technology or change behavior is made at the individual
level
[@Buttel_Jr_Larson_1990; @Rogers_2003],
individuals are shaped by the broader innovation system in which they
are nested [@Klerkx_van_Mierlo_Leeuwis_2012]. An
innovation system is the complex of interactions between actors and
institutions that nurture and diffuse new technologies or practices
based on several interdependent processes, such as policymaking,
knowledge creation, and market formation
[@Bergek_Jacobsson_Carlsson_Lindmark_Rickne_2008].
The interplay between individual behaviors and system level processes is
at the core of successful innovation and transitions. Which processes to
foster for successful transitions, at what scale, and by whom are core
questions in the niche management and innovation system literature
[@Binz_Truffer_2017; @Musiolik_Markard_Hekkert_Furrer_2020; @Smith_Raven_2012; @Suurs_2009].

Across three chapters, this dissertation addresses questions about
sustainability transitions at both the individual and system levels
using the case of organic seed. Among the inputs necessary for
supporting a sustainable agricultural system, seeds are one of the most
foundational. While the dominant seed breeding approach in countries
like the United States is based on high-input, low-diversity and highly
centralized conventional agricultural practices [@Lammerts_van_Bueren_Struik_van_Eekeren_Nuijten_2018],
several alternatives (so-called "niches") have developed to support a
more sustainable system. This work focuses on the organic agriculture
niche, in which seed production systems are typically low-input and high
diversity with polycentric management
[@Colley_2022; @Rohe_Oltmer_Wolter_Gmeiner_Tschersich_2022; @Shelton_Tracy_2015].
The focus on organic seeds was inspired by the Organic Seed Alliance\'s
(OSA) *State of Organic Seed Reports*
[@Dillon_Hubbard_2011; @Hubbard_Zystro_2016].
OSA\'s research conceives of organic seed as part of a broader system --
not just breeding and agronomy, but also policy support, funding
mobilization, community building, and small business development. This
framing mirrors the innovation systems approach, where environmental
challenges require system-level assessments that connect and transcend
disciplines.

The focus of Chapter 1 is on the organic standards in the United States,
specifically, the so-called "seed loophole" whereby growers can use
conventional seed if organic seed is not commercially available and
still retain their organic status. We investigate whether this loophole
helps reduce organic growers\' seed sourcing burden, as the policy
intends, or enables them to free-ride by using conventional seed despite
commercial availability. Drawing on organic grower survey data from
three cross-sections over the last 15 years, we use beta regression to
model individual growers\' seed sourcing behavior. The results of the
regression suggest that the loophole is a double-edged sword in that it
both helps growers facing seed sourcing barriers, and allows some
growers to take advantage of the flexibility by reducing their efforts
in sourcing organic seed. The chapter concludes with several policy
recommendations, which align with the 2022 *State of Organic Seed
Report*
[@Hubbard_Zystro_Wood_2022].
Beyond, it opens up a wider discussion about competing motivations and
identities in sustainability transitions to be considered in future
research.

Chapters 2 and 3 broaden the scope of study from the individual-level to
the system-level. Both of these chapters draw on innovation system
theory, combined with policy network and social network literature, to
quantify and explain the relationships within the organic seed
innovation system as a network. We use survey data of over 200 organic
seed stakeholders within and outside the United States, collected
between 2020-2022, to create a multi-functional innovation system
network comprising 645 actors and 1206 connections between them. These
connections operationalize knowledge and market-based relationships
between organic seed producers, researchers, companies, and non-profit
organizations.

In detail, Chapter 2 focuses on explaining the spatial structure of the
US organic seed network, testing the propositions defined by the Global
Innovation Systems framework
[@Binz_Truffer_2017]. Using
n-clan compositional analysis and Exponential Random Graph Modeling, we
find support for the framework\'s proposition that types of innovation
and production valuation are two key conditions predicting the
innovation network\'s spatial structure. In line with these conditions,
we find that the organic seed system has a "spatially sticky" network
structure, in that both knowledge creation and product valuation are
territorially embedded in different regions of the country. But even in
a regionally sticky innovation system, we find that national-scale
actors (e.g. the US national germplasm repository) serve a prominent
role in connecting regional networks. These results highlight both the
importance of tailoring policies to the place-specific needs of regional
organic seed systems, and the importance of coordination from
higher-scale actors.

Chapter 3 investigates the processes and actor composition of the
organic seed innovation system. Again using Exponential Random Graph
Modeling on the organic seed networks, we test two theories in parallel:
resource-based theory of system building
[@Musiolik_Markard_Hekkert_Furrer_2020]
and the institutional logics of the multi-actor perspective
[@Avelino_Wittmayer_2016]. In
line with the expectations from the resource-based theory, we find that
the organic seed network is shaped primarily by "partner mode"
structures, suggesting that cooperative and complementary
resource-sharing relationships drive system formation. Second, our
results align with the proposition that actors\' "institutional
logics" affect their activity in certain network functions. For
example, non-profit actors are generally more active in pre-competitive
activities like knowledge creation, while for-profit actors are more
active in market-based functions like value chain creation. The one
exception is governmental actors, who are more active in market-based
functions, pointing to their innovation-nurturing role when niches are
not yet competitive.

Together, the chapters in this dissertation make the following
contributions. Chapter 1 analyzes the effects of the "seed loophole"
in the United States organic standard, and makes several policy
recommendations for achieving the intended effects of the policy while
curbing free-riding behavior on the part of organic growers. Chapters 2
and 3 contribute to the field of sustainability transitions by
empirically testing and extending innovation system theory using
inferential network analysis. By employing Exponential Random Graph
Models, these chapters not only describe the organic seed network, but
also investigate its structural determinants to help build a more
generalizable understanding of innovation system formation. This work
combines theory and methods from the two otherwise disparate bodies of
knowledge on innovation systems and policy networks, to help deepen our
understanding of managing and supporting sustainability transitions.
