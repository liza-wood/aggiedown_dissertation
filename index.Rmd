  Does this have to be a quotes?
acknowledgments: |
  I could not have completed this dissertation without the help of my mentors and academic community. I would first like to thank my committee, Mark Lubell, Tyler Scott, and Neil McRoberts. They have been instrumental in helping me become a more skilled and confident researcher. Likewise, the community at the Center for Environmental Policy have played an enormous role in shaping who I am as an academic. Each and every member of the group has helped hold me accountable to being a rigorous and concientious researcher. I'd also like to thank the Graduate Group in Ecology, 2018 cohort and beyond, for creating an inclusive and outright _fun_ environment for completing the PhD. And the UC Davis DataLab, who have played an important role in supporting my development as a data scientist.
