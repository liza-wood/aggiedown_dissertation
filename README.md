## Thesis writing with `aggiedown`  

This is a personal repository for my University of California, Davis PhD thesis, compiled with the help of the [`aggiedown` package](https://github.com/ryanpeek/aggiedown). The repository is a model of a thesis completed with `aggiedown`, bringing in chapters written in Google Sheets and analyses/data from the following repositories:
* Chapter 1: www.github.com/liza-wood/organicseed_adoption
* Chapter 2: www.github.com/liza-wood/osisn_spatial
* Chapter 3: www.github.com/liza-wood/osisn_processes

This repository adds to the recommended `aggiedown` model by creating two functions in the prep_papers.R script. These functions read in chapter text and embedded figures and tables written in Google docs, rather than writing chapters directly into an RMarkdown document. A draft explanation of how this works is reported in my tutorial on [converting Google docs into a LaTeX report via `aggiedown`](https://liza-wood.github.io/posts/googledoc-aggiedown.html).
